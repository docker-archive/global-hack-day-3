# Docker Flow

Docker Flow manages workflow running in Docker containers. 

With Docker Flow you can define your workflow in yaml files, docker-flow reads the container requirements and execution steps for each job, and uses docker-compose to define Dockerfiles, container linkings and exposed ports, builds docker images, and runs composed application stack in Docker swarm. 

##### Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dockerflow/docker-flow.git
python setup.py install
```

##### Workflow YAML
A workflow yaml file looks like the following: 

```yaml
name: celery-build-test-flow
description: Workflow for building and testing celery package
volumes:
    - /local/exports/workspace:/workspace
    - /local/exports/builds:/builds
jobs:
    - build-celery-sdist:
        image: python:2.7
        working_dir: /workspace
        steps:
           - set -x
           - cd /workspace
           - rm -rf /workspace/*
           - git clone https://github.com/celery/celery
           - cd celery
           - python setup.py sdist
           - cp /workspace/celery/dist/* /builds
        output: /builds/celery-*.tar.gz
```
- The name of the workflow is required
- Volumes can be defined at workflow level or at job level. Volumes defined at the workflow level are mounted to the main container in every job; volumes at job level are only mounted to the main container for that job. Sharing volumes among jobs is necessary when multiple jobs shares files or artifacts, for example, the job "build" builds a pypi package and copied is to a mounted volume /builds, then the next job "functest" installs the pypi package from /builds and runs functional tests in another container. 
- Multiple jobs can be defined. A job's "image" is the container base image that will be used by docker-compose to build Dockerfile, "steps" are the commands to execute in that container. When docker-flow builds Dockerfile, the steps becomes an entrypoint script that gets install the docker image. See more examples at https://github.com/dockerflow/docker-flow/tree/master/examples/flows .


##### Usage

```bash
docker-flow --help
usage: docker-flow [-h] -f FILE [-b BUILD_DIR]

docker-flow

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -f FILE, --file FILE  The workflow file
  -b BUILD_DIR, --build-dir BUILD_DIR
                        Directory docker-flow will save Dockerfile, compose
                        files to
```
The workflow file is required, you need to provide path to a workflow yaml files with -f or --file. For example: 
```bash
docker-flow --file ~/github/docker-flow/examples/flows/celery-build-test-tornado.yml
```
The build_dir is ~/.docker-flow/builds by default, and can be set to alternative directories by passing in a directory name with -b or --build-dir. 


##### Dockerfiles and Compose Files
The Dockerfile and compose files generated by running the docker-flow command are save to <build_dir>/<workflow_name>. You can manually run docker-compose using these files. See example below. 


##### Example
```bash
mkvirtualenv dockerflow
git clone https://github.com/dockerflow/docker-flow.git
python setup.py install
docker-flow -f examples/flows/celery-build-test-tornado.yml

Running the workflow Dockerfile-functest-tornado-celery.yml created entrypoint scripts and Dockerfile for 2 jobs: 
- build-celery-sdist 
- functest-tornado-celery

The build directory for the workflow is named after the workflow name, and the entrypoint and Dockerfiles for each job are named after the job: 
```
ls -al ~/.docker-flow/build/celery-build-test-tornado
total 48
drwxr-xr-x  8 cindy.cao  staff  272 Sep 20 22:49 .
drwxr-xr-x  5 cindy.cao  staff  170 Sep 20 22:48 ..

```

A generated compose file can be manually re-run:
```
cd ~/.docker-flow/build/celery-build-test-tornado
docker-compose -f docker-compose-build-celery-sdist.yml up
```
